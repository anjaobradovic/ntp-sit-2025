Hangman+ is a desktop application built with Rust, Tauri, and React, designed to make learning human anatomy more engaging and interactive.

The game is based on the classic Hangman concept, extended with:

medical terminology related to the human body (bones, organs, anatomy),

visual learning through images,

multilingual support (e.g. English and Serbian),

user progress tracking and game statistics.

Hangman+ is primarily aimed at medical students, but it can also be used by anyone interested in learning human anatomy in a fun and educational way.
